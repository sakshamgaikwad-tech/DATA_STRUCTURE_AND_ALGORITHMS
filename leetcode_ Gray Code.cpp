// problem : An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:

// Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
// The first integer is 0,
// An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
// The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
// The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.
// Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.
